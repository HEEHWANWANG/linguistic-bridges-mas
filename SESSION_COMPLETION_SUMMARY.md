## Strategic Decisions Made

### 1. Contribution Type
**Decision**: Benchmark + Architecture Innovation (combined)

**Rationale**:
- Benchmark alone: Strong for AAMAS, insufficient for Tier-1 venues
- Architecture alone: Viable for ICLR/ICML, fits multimodal domain well
- Combined approach: Provides flexibility (benchmark to AAAI, architecture to ICLR, both to AAMAS)
- Lower risk than pure algorithmic innovation (QMIX, MAPPO already strong)

---

### 2. Primary Publication Venue
**Decision**: AAMAS 2026 (May 2026 conference, June 2025 deadline)

**Venue Comparison**:
| Venue | Acceptance | Why Choice | Why Not Primary |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| AAMAS | 25% | Agent-centric, applications focus, multimodal-friendly | Slightly less prestige than Tier-1 |
| ICLR | 25% | Architecture innovation strong fit | Higher bar, broader audience |
| ICML | 22% | Methodological rigor | Less agent-specific |
| IJCAI | 15% | Broad technical excellence | Lower acceptance rate |
| NeurIPS | 20% | Highest prestige | Highest algorithmic novelty bar |

**Why AAMAS Primary**:
- Highest acceptance rate for LB's contribution type
- Most aligned with agent systems focus
- Fastest decision timeline
- Increasingly receptive to multimodal work
- Still top-tier venue with strong reputation

**Backup venues** (in order):
1. IJCAI
2. ICLR
3. AAAI
4. ICML

---

### 3. Research Gap Focus
**Primary**: Research Gap #8 (Real-World Applications)
- Most MARL papers use simulated environments
- LB's music application is genuinely novel and real-world
- Papers with real-world focus have higher citations

**Secondary**: Research Gap #3 (LLM Integration)
- Emerging trend combining MARL with language models
- LB's linguistic agents leverage this trend
- High novelty potential

**Tertiary**: Research Gap #2 (Heterogeneous Agents)
- Most MARL assumes homogeneous agents
- LB's visual-audio-linguistic agents are naturally heterogeneous
- Organic fit for this gap

---

### 4. Timeline
**Total Duration**: 13 months (Oct 2025 - Oct 2026)
**AAMAS Submission**: June 2025 (Month 9)
**Decision Date**: October 2026 (Month 13)

**Phases**:
- Q4 2025 (8 weeks): PoC
- Q1 2026 (13 weeks): Prototype
- Q2 2026 (13 weeks): Paper submission
- Q3 2026 (13 weeks): Feedback iteration
- Q4 2026 (9 weeks): Publication

- Heterogeneous agents emerging as important research direction

### About LB's Position
- Unique combination of music + visual + linguistic + MARL
- Addresses multiple research gaps simultaneously (rare advantage)
- Natural fit for agent-centric venue (AAMAS)
- Clear path to both applied and theoretical contributions

### About Publication Strategy
- Contribution type matters more than raw novelty
- Venue selection should match research focus, not just prestige
- Benchmark + Architecture combination provides flexibility
- Real-world applications have higher acceptance and citation rates

## Transition to Execution

This strategic planning session creates the foundation for the execution phase (Q4 2025 and beyond). The three guilds can now:

1. **Research Guild**: Finalize hypothesis and begin competitive analysis
2. **Forge Guild**: Complete architecture design and establish dev environment
3. **Chroniclers Guild**: Create documentation templates and summary cards

All future work should reference these strategy documents to ensure alignment with published goals and timeline.

---

## Document Maintenance

These strategy documents should be reviewed and updated:
- **Quarterly**: Full review against actual progress, update timelines if needed
- **Monthly**: Check alignment with roadmap tasks
- **Weekly**: Reference for task assignment and coordination
- **As needed**: If major changes occur (new papers, venue changes, resource constraints)
