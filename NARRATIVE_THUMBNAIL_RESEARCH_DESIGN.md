# Narrative Thumbnail Generation via Multi-Agent Analysis
## Research Design for AI Conference Publication

A competitive research contribution combining multi-agent systems, music understanding, and visual narrative generation.

---

## Executive Summary

This research proposes **HarmonicVisuals**: a multi-agent system that generates narrative-driven image thumbnails for pop music by coordinating specialized agents that analyze different musical dimensions (rhythm, emotion, structure, narrative) and synthesize their analyses into visual narratives through iterative prompt refinement.

**Key Innovation**: Unlike previous music-to-visual approaches that treat music as a single modality, our system leverages **heterogeneous agent specialization** to capture multi-dimensional musical understanding, with explicit mechanisms to preserve **artistic outlier perspectives** that enhance visual creativity.

**Publication Potential**: High (AAMAS, IJCAI, AAAI tracks + potential Tier-1 with extended theory)

---

## Part 1: Problem Formulation & Motivation

### The Problem
**Music-to-Visual Narrative Gap**: Current approaches to music visualization typically:
- Generate static/abstract visualizations (waveforms, spectrograms)
- Miss narrative structure (how story unfolds across song sections)
- Ignore emotional arc (tension, release, climax)
- Fail to leverage human musical understanding
- Treat all musical perspectives equally (missing creative outliers)

**Why It Matters**:
- Music videos are primary format for pop music (YouTube dominance)
- Manual thumbnail creation is expensive and time-consuming
- Automated approaches could democratize music production
- Multi-agent approach enables capturing diverse musical perspectives
- Narrative-driven visuals have higher engagement metrics

### The Opportunity
**Multi-Agent Coordination for Multimodal Understanding**:
1. **Different agents specialize in different musical dimensions**
   - Technical Agent: Analyzes rhythm, structure, form
   - Emotional Agent: Interprets emotional arc, mood, intensity
   - Narrative Agent: Extracts storytelling elements, themes
   - Artistic Agent: Proposes creative, unconventional interpretations

2. **Agents negotiate and synthesize perspectives** into coherent visual narratives

3. **System explicitly values divergent thinking** rather than converging on consensus
   - Preserves "artistic outlier" perspectives
   - Balances consensus with creative novelty
   - Creates more interesting, less predictable outputs

---

## Part 2: Research Contribution & Novelty

### Core Research Questions

**RQ1**: How can multiple agents specializing in different musical dimensions coordinate to create coherent visual narratives?

**RQ2**: What mechanisms preserve creative outlier perspectives while maintaining overall narrative consistency?

**RQ3**: How does multi-agent musical analysis improve visual narrative quality compared to single-agent approaches?

**RQ4**: Can iterative refinement of image generation prompts based on agent feedback improve visual-musical alignment?

### Novel Contributions

#### Contribution 1: Heterogeneous Music Agent Architecture
**What**: A specialized agent architecture where agents analyze music through different conceptual lenses

**Technical Details**:
- **Technical Agent**: Analyzes musical form (intro, verse, chorus, bridge, outro)
  - Input: Audio features (tempo, rhythm patterns, harmonic structure)
  - Output: Structural narrative ("tension building", "resolution", "climax")

- **Emotional Agent**: Interprets emotional trajectory
  - Input: Psychoacoustic features (brightness, dynamics, texture)
  - Output: Emotional concepts ("nostalgia", "euphoria", "melancholy")

- **Narrative Agent**: Extracts thematic storytelling
  - Input: Lyrical themes, genre conventions, cultural context
  - Output: Story elements ("journey", "heartbreak", "celebration")

- **Artistic Agent**: Proposes creative reinterpretations
  - Input: All above + latent divergence signals
  - Output: Novel visual metaphors ("synesthesia mapping", "abstract symbolism")

**Why Novel**:
- First work explicitly combining MARL with music analysis for visual generation
- Heterogeneous agent specialization underexplored in music domain
- Explicit architectural support for creative divergence

#### Contribution 2: Artistic Outlier Preservation Mechanism
**What**: Algorithm to identify, preserve, and intelligently integrate perspectives that diverge from agent consensus

**Technical Approach**:
```
For each song section:
1. Agents propose visual narratives independently
2. Calculate consensus representation (mean/mode of proposals)
3. Identify divergence signals:
   - Artistic agent proposals > θ distance from consensus
   - Novel metaphors not proposed by other agents
   - Creative synthesis of seemingly incompatible ideas

4. Outlier evaluation:
   - Assess "creativity score" (novelty + coherence)
   - Preserve if: novelty > threshold AND coherence > threshold
   - Integrate into final representation

5. Result: Visual narrative that preserves consensus + creative outliers
```

**Why Novel**:
- Most MARL systems optimize for consensus (minimize disagreement)
- This work shows creative disagreement can enhance outcomes
- First explicit "outlier preservation" mechanism in visual generation
- Challenges optimization assumption in multi-agent systems

#### Contribution 3: Iterative Prompt Refinement via Agent Feedback
**What**: Mechanism where agents review generated images and iteratively refine prompts

**Process Loop**:
```
Iteration 1:
  → Agents propose visual narrative for song section
  → System generates prompt from narrative
  → Image generator creates images
  → Agents evaluate: "Does image match proposed narrative?"

Iteration 2 (if mismatch):
  → Agents identify failure reasons
  → Refine narrative descriptions (more specific, add constraints)
  → Regenerate prompt
  → Image generator creates new images

Repeat until convergence or max iterations
```

**Why Novel**:
- Closes feedback loop between musical understanding and visual generation
- Agents act as quality evaluators, not just proposers
- Iterative refinement uncommon in music-to-visual systems
- Combines symbolic reasoning (agent narratives) + neural generation (diffusion models)

#### Contribution 4: Song Structure-Aware Thumbnail Generation
**What**: System explicitly models narrative arc across entire song, not just isolated frames

**Narrative Arc Representation**:
- **Act 1 (Intro)**: Establishment - introduce visual themes
- **Act 2 (Verse 1-2)**: Development - build narrative, develop themes
- **Act 3 (Chorus)**: Climax - intensify visual/emotional impact
- **Act 4 (Bridge)**: Complication - introduce conflict or variation
- **Act 5 (Outro)**: Resolution - conclude narrative arc

Each section inherits context from previous, builds toward overall arc.

**Why Novel**:
- Most systems treat each frame independently
- This preserves narrative coherence across temporal structure
- Explicit modeling of song form (rare in visual generation)
- Creates "visual story" rather than disconnected images

## Part 3: Technical Architecture

### System Components

#### 1. Music Analysis Module
```
Input: Audio file + lyrics (optional)
↓
Audio feature extraction:
  - Spectral analysis (chromagram, MFCC, spectral centroid)
  - Rhythm analysis (tempo, beat strength, groove patterns)
  - Harmonic analysis (key, chord progressions, harmonic tension)
  - Dynamic analysis (loudness, intensity, dynamics curve)
↓
Lyrical/thematic analysis (if available):
  - Theme extraction (love, loss, celebration, etc.)
  - Emotional keywords
  - Narrative elements
↓
Output: Structured musical representation
```

#### 2. Multi-Agent Coordination Module

**Technical Agent** (Structured Reasoning)
```python
Input: Musical features
Processing:
  - Pattern matching: tempo → urgency level
  - Structure detection: chorus → intensity peak
  - Form analysis: verse/chorus/bridge → narrative progression
Output: Form-aware narrative concepts
  Example: {section: "chorus", intensity: "high",
            structure: "climax", pacing: "accelerating"}
```

**Emotional Agent** (Affective Computing)
```python
Input: Psychoacoustic features + energy contour
Processing:
  - Valence estimation (positive/negative)
  - Arousal estimation (calm/excited)
  - Emotional trajectory (increasing/decreasing emotion)
  - Tension-release patterns
Output: Emotion-driven visual metaphors
  Example: {valence: "positive", arousal: "high",
            trajectory: "building_to_peak",
            dominant_emotion: "euphoria"}
```

**Narrative Agent** (Semantic Analysis)
```python
Input: Lyrics + genre context + cultural context
Processing:
  - Theme identification
  - Character/story elements
  - Narrative structure (exposition, conflict, resolution)
  - Symbolic meaning extraction
Output: Story-driven visual elements
  Example: {theme: "journey", elements: ["destination", "transformation"],
            story_arc: "self-discovery", tone: "inspirational"}
```

**Artistic Agent** (Creative Synthesis)
```python
Input: All other agents' outputs + divergence signals
Processing:
  - Identify consensus visual narratives
  - Generate creative alternatives
  - Propose unconventional metaphors
  - Suggest artistic reinterpretations
Output: Novel creative perspectives
  Example: {consensus: "vibrant celebration",
            alternative: "abstract emotional geometry",
            metaphor: "synesthesia of sound as color flow",
            novelty_score: 0.82}
```

#### 3. Consensus & Outlier Integration
```
Step 1: Collect all agent proposals for section
Step 2: Calculate consensus representation
Step 3: Identify outliers (divergence > threshold + high creativity score)
Step 4: Integrate:
  - 70% from consensus narrative
  - 30% from creative outliers (if selected)
  - Resolve conflicts through weighting
Step 5: Output: Hybrid narrative that preserves diversity
```

#### 4. Prompt Generation & Refinement
```
Input: Agent narratives (consensus + outliers)
↓
Prompt construction:
  - Visual style guidelines (from agents)
  - Content requirements (objects, colors, composition)
  - Emotional tone (from emotional agent)
  - Narrative elements (from narrative agent)
  - Creative directives (from artistic agent)
↓
Example prompt:
"Create a visually striking image for the chorus of [Song Name].
Style: Vibrant, energetic, saturated colors
Content: Dynamic geometric forms transforming, with warm golds/ambers
Emotion: Euphoric climax, building intensity, moment of triumph
Narrative: Transformation and celebration intertwined
Creative direction: Let colors flow like synaesthetic sound waves,
with abstract geometry representing emotional peak
Constraints: Avoid literal representation, emphasize emotional truth"
↓
Output: Image from diffusion model (DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, etc.)
```

#### 5. Iterative Refinement Loop
```
For each section:
  iteration = 0
  while iteration < max_iterations:

    # Generate image from current prompt
    image = generate_image(prompt)

    # Agents evaluate image
    evaluations = []
    for agent in [technical, emotional, narrative, artistic]:
      evaluation = agent.evaluate(image, proposed_narrative)
      # evaluation: {alignment_score, feedback, refinement_suggestions}
      evaluations.append(evaluation)

    # Check convergence
    if all(eval.alignment_score > 0.8 for eval in evaluations):
      break  # Narrative successfully visualized

    # Refine narrative based on feedback
    feedback = synthesize_feedback(evaluations)
    prompt = refine_prompt(prompt, feedback)
    iteration += 1

  output: final_image, refinement_iterations, final_alignment_score
```

## Part 4: Experimental Design

### Benchmark & Dataset

#### Dataset: PopMusic-Narrative
**Construction**:
- 50 diverse pop songs (various genres, tempos, emotions)
- For each song:
  - Full audio (44.1kHz, stereo)
  - Lyrics with timestamps
  - Manual annotation: 3-5 images per song section (intro, verse, chorus, bridge, outro)
  - Metadata: genre, tempo, key, artist, release year

**Sources**:
- Creative Commons music (free to use)
- Independent artists (with permission)
- Diverse in: mood, structure, language, cultural context

**Annotation Protocol**:
- 3 professional musicians annotate each song
- 2 visual designers create reference thumbnails
- Voting: select 1-2 reference images per section (consensus)
- Document: what makes each image effective for that section

#### Baselines

**Baseline 1: Single-Agent Music Visualization**
- Traditional approach: audio features → visual patterns directly
- Waveform visualization, spectrogram coloring
- Metric: visual-musical alignment (user study)

**Baseline 2: LLM-Only Prompt Generation**
- Give ChatGPT/Claude song lyrics + structure
- Generate prompts without agent coordination
- Metric: prompt quality, image diversity

**Baseline 3: Image Search Retrieval**
- Retrieve existing images matching song themes
- No generation, only search + ranking
- Metric: relevance, diversity, coverage

**Proposed: HarmonicVisuals (Multi-Agent + Iterative Refinement)**
- Full system with agent coordination + outlier preservation + iteration
- Metric: visual-musical alignment, creativity, narrative coherence

### Evaluation Metrics

#### Automatic Metrics

1. **Visual-Musical Alignment Score**
   - Measure how well generated image matches song at that moment
   - Calculated by specialized model trained on music-image pairs
   - Range: 0-1 (higher is better)

2. **Narrative Coherence**
   - Measure if sequence of images tells coherent story
   - Evaluated by narrative understanding model
   - Range: 0-1 (higher is better)

3. **Creativity Score**
   - Measure visual novelty (diversity from typical images)
   - Using CLIP embeddings + diversity metrics
   - Range: 0-1 (higher is better)

4. **Prompt Quality**
   - Length, specificity, constraint clarity
   - Correlation with image quality
   - Range: 0-1 (higher is better)

#### Human Evaluation (Gold Standard)

**Participant Pool**: 100 participants (mix of musicians, designers, general users)

**Evaluation Protocol** (per song section):
1. Listen to 10-15 second song clip
2. View generated image
3. Rate on 5-point Likert scales:
   - **Visual-Musical Alignment**: How well does image match this song moment?
   - **Emotional Resonance**: Does image evoke appropriate emotion?
   - **Narrative Fit**: Does image fit song's story/theme?
   - **Artistic Quality**: Is image interesting and well-composed?
   - **Creativity**: How novel/unexpected is the image?

4. Comparative evaluation:
   - View images from baseline + HarmonicVisuals side-by-side
   - Which better captures song? Why?

**Statistical Analysis**:
- Mean scores + std dev per condition
- Paired t-tests (HarmonicVisuals vs. each baseline)
- Effect sizes (Cohen's d)
- Qualitative theme analysis from open-ended feedback

### Expected Results

**Hypothesis 1**: Multi-agent coordination produces more musically-aligned thumbnails
- Prediction: HarmonicVisuals > Baselines on alignment (p < 0.05, d > 0.5)
- Mechanism: Agents capture different musical dimensions, synthesis is richer

**Hypothesis 2**: Outlier preservation increases creativity without sacrificing coherence
- Prediction: HarmonicVisuals high on both creativity AND coherence
- Mechanism: Artistic agent's outliers add novelty while consensus maintains structure

**Hypothesis 3**: Iterative refinement improves visual-musical alignment
- Prediction: Alignment increases with iterations (convergence curve)
- Mechanism: Agents' feedback tightens connection between narrative + visual

**Hypothesis 4**: Agent diversity matters (heterogeneous > homogeneous)
- Prediction: All-agent system > subsystems with fewer agent types
- Mechanism: Different agents capture different musical aspects

## Part 7: Differentiation & Competitive Advantage

### Why This Work Stands Out

#### 1. **Creative Disagreement as Feature, Not Bug**
- Most MARL: minimize disagreement → consensus
- This work: **preserve creative disagreement → artistic novelty**
- Novel insight: outlier perspectives can enhance creative outcomes
- Challenges fundamental assumption in multi-agent optimization

#### 2. **Explainable Visual Generation**
- Black-box diffusion models lack interpretability
- This work: agents explain visual choices symbolically
- Each image has explicit narrative rationale
- Users/creators can understand why that image was generated

#### 3. **Music Structure Awareness**
- Most: treat images independently
- This work: narrative arc across entire song
- Generates "visual story" with coherent progression
- First explicit modeling of song form in visual generation

#### 4. **Heterogeneous Agent Specialization**
- Most MARL: homogeneous agent populations
- This work: different agents, different knowledge/capabilities
- Mirrors how humans understand music (musicians, dancers, listeners)
- More cognitively plausible

#### 5. **Tight Feedback Loop**
- Most: one-shot generation (music → prompt → image)
- This work: iterative refinement with agent feedback
- Agents act as quality validators
- Closes symbolic reasoning → neural generation → evaluation loop

---

## Part 9: Extended Contributions (For Tier-1 Expansion)

### Extension 1: Theoretical Analysis of Outlier Preservation

**Research Question**: Under what conditions does outlier preservation improve multi-agent system outcomes?

**Theoretical Framework**:
- Model outlier contributions as additional "innovative actions"
- Analyze convergence properties when outliers are included
- Prove: creative diversity doesn't prevent convergence
- Game-theoretic analysis: incentives for agents to propose outliers

**Expected Result**: Paper showing mathematical guarantees on performance with outliers

### Extension 2: Cross-Domain Transfer

**Question**: Does system trained on pop music generalize to other genres?

**Experiments**:
- Train on pop music (50 songs)
- Test on: classical, jazz, electronic, metal, country
- Measure transfer learning performance
- Fine-tune with minimal data (few-shot learning)

**Expected**: System transfers well due to universal musical principles

### Extension 3: Agent Specialization Analysis

**Question**: What knowledge does each agent capture? Can we quantify their contributions?

**Method**:
- Train individual agents, then combinations
- Information theory analysis: mutual information between agents
- Ablation studies showing which agents matter for which genres
- Agent specialization heatmaps

**Expected**: Clear evidence that heterogeneous agents outperform homogeneous

### Extension 4: Multimodal Extensions

**Idea**: Apply same approach to other modalities
- Text-to-visual: Story → images
- Color-to-visual: Emotional palettes → visual metaphors
- Dance-to-visual: Movement → visual narrative

**Contribution**: Framework that generalizes beyond music

## Part 11: Research Gap Alignment

### Addressing Gap #2: Heterogeneous Agents
**Gap**: Most MARL assumes homogeneous agents
**LB's solution**: Different agents (technical, emotional, narrative, artistic) with different knowledge/capabilities
**Evidence**: Ablation studies showing each agent type contributes unique value

### Addressing Gap #3: LLM Integration
**Gap**: Limited work combining MARL with language models
**LB's solution**: Use LLMs for musical understanding (lyrics, themes, narratives)
**Evidence**: Agent reasoning explicitly uses language to understand music

### Addressing Gap #8: Real-World Applications
**Gap**: Most MARL stays in simulation
**LB's solution**: Tangible application (generating actual thumbnail images for songs)
**Evidence**: Human evaluation with real music/images, potential deployment path

### Bonus: Multimodal (Emerging Trend)
**Contribution**: Combines music + visual + language modalities
**Novelty**: First work explicitly fusing all three through agent coordination

---

## Conclusion

**HarmonicVisuals** is a competitive research contribution that combines:
1. **Novel agent architecture** (heterogeneous specialization)
2. **New coordination mechanism** (outlier preservation)
3. **Multimodal understanding** (music + visual + language)
4. **Real-world application** (thumbnail generation)
5. **Challenging assumption** (creative disagreement > consensus)

**Publication timeline**: Q4 2025 - Q2 2026 for AAMAS submission (June deadline)

**Expected outcome**: Publication at AAMAS 2026 + pathway to Tier-1 venues with extended contributions

**Impact potential**: Influences how MARL systems handle creative tasks, values diverse perspectives, and addresses real-world problems
