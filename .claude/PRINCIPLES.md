# Linguistic Bridges - Core Principles

**Core Directive**: Evidence > Assumptions | Code > Documentation | Quality > Speed (except emergencies)

## Philosophy

**Task-First Approach**: Understand → Plan → Execute → Validate

**Evidence-Based Reasoning**: All claims verifiable through testing, research, or documentation

**Parallel Thinking**: Maximize efficiency through intelligent batching and concurrent execution

**Context Awareness**: Maintain project understanding across sessions and operations

## Engineering Mindset

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each agent, guild, or component has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension (new hypotheses, new models), closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Agents can be substituted without breaking orchestration
- **Interface Segregation**: Agents only depend on methods they actually use
- **Dependency Inversion**: Guilds depend on abstractions (MCP), not concrete implementations

### Core Patterns
- **DRY**: Abstract common agent behaviors into base classes
- **KISS**: Prefer simple hypotheses over complex ones
- **YAGNI**: Implement current research requirements only

### Systems Thinking
- **Ripple Effects**: Consider how hypothesis changes affect all three guilds
- **Long-term Perspective**: Balance quick wins vs. sustainable architecture
- **Feedback Loops**: Hypothesis evolution, track iteration, documentation refinement

## Research Principles

### Hypothesis Quality
- **Novelty**: Propose genuinely new insights into music-visual alignment
- **Falsifiability**: Hypotheses must be testable and disprovable
- **Parsimony**: Prefer simpler explanations supported by evidence
- **Interdisciplinarity**: Leverage insights from linguistics, music theory, vision

### Experimental Rigor
- **Reproducibility**: All experiments documented for future reproduction
- **Baseline Comparison**: Compare against existing approaches
- **Statistical Significance**: Report confidence intervals and p-values
- **Ablation Studies**: Isolate contribution of each component

## Implementation Principles

### Code Quality
- **Clarity**: Code is read more often than written
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage before deployment
- **Performance**: Measure before optimizing
- **Security**: Protection by default, not by afterthought

### Parallel Execution
- **Default Concurrency**: All independent operations run in parallel
- **Resource Efficiency**: Monitor GPU, memory, API quotas
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time visibility into all tracks
- **Failure Recovery**: Graceful degradation with logging

## Documentation Principles

### Audience-Focused
- **Researchers**: What hypotheses are being tested and why?
- **Implementers**: How are algorithms structured and configured?
- **Evaluators**: What metrics demonstrate success?
- **Replicators**: Can someone reproduce these results from scratch?

### Quality Standards
- **Correctness**: Documentation matches code behavior
- **Completeness**: All major components and flows documented
- **Clarity**: Accessible to intelligent people unfamiliar with details
- **Navigability**: Readers can easily find relevant sections

## Decision Framework

### Data-Driven Choices
- **Measure First**: Base optimization decisions on actual data
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Formulate and test systematically
- **Source Validation**: Verify research paper credibility
- **Bias Recognition**: Account for confirmation bias

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Temporal Impact**: Immediate progress vs. long-term maintainability
- **Reversibility**: Easy to change vs. locked-in decisions
- **Option Preservation**: Keep flexibility under uncertainty

### Risk Management
- **Proactive Identification**: Anticipate bottlenecks before manifestation
- **Impact Assessment**: Probability × Severity evaluation
- **Mitigation Planning**: Develop recovery strategies

## Quality Philosophy

### Quality Quadrants
- **Functional**: Correctness, reliability, reproducibility
- **Structural**: Code organization, documentation, maintainability
- **Performance**: Speed, memory efficiency, scalability
- **Scientific**: Novelty, rigor, impact

### Quality Standards
- **Automated Enforcement**: Use linting, testing, type checking
- **Preventive Measures**: Catch issues early when cheaper to fix
- **Human Review**: Expert evaluation of novel approaches

## Collaboration Principles

### Guild Independence
- **Autonomy**: Each guild operates within its domain
- **Shared Goals**: All guilds aligned on overall project success
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined communication between guilds
- **Conflict Resolution**: Supervisor mediates disagreements

### Knowledge Sharing
- **Documentation**: Insights captured for future reference
- **Memory Persistence**: Cross-session learning enabled
- **Reverse Learning**: Implementation insights feed back to research

## Excellence Standards

- **Vision Clarity**: All participants understand the overarching goal
- **Disciplined Execution**: Systematic approach to hypothesis and implementation
- **Continuous Learning**: Each cycle extracts lessons for improvement
- **Impact Focus**: Ultimately about advancing understanding of music-visual alignment
