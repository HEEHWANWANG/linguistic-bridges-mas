### TIER 2: SOLID FIT VENUES

#### ✅ AAMAS (International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems)

**When**: February 1 deadline (annual)
**Venue Type**: Main conference

### TIER 3: POSSIBLE BUT LESS IDEAL

#### ✅ NeurIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems)

**When**: September 15 deadline (annual)
**Venue Type**: Main conference
**Acceptance Rate**: 20-30%

**Best For**: Novel algorithms or theoretical insights (if you have them)

**Positioning** (Hard to position):
- This is awkward fit - neither pure NLP nor pure MARL
- Could position as "creative AI" or "multi-modal generation"
- Would need to emphasize novel mechanisms over applications

**Strengths**:
- Highest prestige overall
- Very broad audience
- Good acceptance rate
- Good venue if you do ML research

**Weaknesses**:
- Hard to position without novel algorithm/theory
- Application-heavy papers less preferred
- Multidisciplinary = risky positioning
- Very competitive in general

**Recommendation**: ⭐⭐ **NOT RECOMMENDED**
Unless you develop novel training algorithm

**Why Not**:
- NeurIPS better for "new algorithm/architecture"
- HarmonicVisuals is "new task + new application" not "new algorithm"
- Better fit at domain-specific venues

---

#### ❌ CVPR (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)

**When**: November 15 deadline
**Venue Type**: Main conference
**Acceptance Rate**: 25-30%

**Best For**: Computer vision (image generation, visual understanding)

**Positioning** (Not Recommended):
- Could position as vision-language model
- But would de-emphasize NLP contributions
- Focus on image generation quality

**Weaknesses**:
- CVPR cares more about visual output quality than language understanding
- Your strength is NLP (language understanding), not vision
- Would require repositioning that weakens NLP angle
- Vision-language papers go to vision+language workshops, not main track

**Recommendation**: ❌ **AVOID**
NLP venues better match your core contributions

---

### TIER 4: WORKSHOP OPTIONS

#### ✅ ACL Workshop on Language and Creativity

**When**: Typically March-April deadline
**Venue Type**: Workshop (1 day, 4-6 pages)
**Acceptance Rate**: 50-60%

**Best For**: Early-stage ideas, novel creative approaches, preliminary results

**Positioning**:
- Preserving poetic intent through multi-modal understanding
- Creative NLP and linguistic diversity
- Novel evaluation metrics for artistic language

**Strengths**:
- Much higher acceptance rate (50-60%)
- Perfect audience for creative language work
- Can submit preliminary results
- Faster feedback
- No need for full evaluation

**Weaknesses**:
- Lower prestige than main conference
- Smaller audience
- Not primary publication (should be supplementary)

**Recommendation**: ⭐ **SUPPLEMENTARY OPTION**
Good for getting feedback before main conference submission
But should publish in main conference as primary

## Decision Matrix: Which Venue to Choose?

### If Priority #1: Maximize Publication Chances ✅

**Recommended Strategy: Tier Down**

1. **First Submission**: NAACL (25-30% acceptance)
   - Good fit, higher acceptance
   - If rejected → learn from feedback

2. **Second Submission**: EMNLP (20-25% acceptance)
   - Use feedback from NAACL rejection
   - Strengthen empirical results

3. **Third Submission**: ACL (20-25% acceptance)
   - Polish based on previous feedback
   - Most competitive but best prestige if accepted

**Timeline**: Submit sequentially over 12 months

---

### If Priority #1: Maximize Prestige ⭐

**Recommended Strategy: Go Big**

1. **First Choice**: ACL
   - Most prestigious
   - Best community fit
   - Higher impact if accepted

2. **Backup**: AAMAS (if pursuing MARL angle)
   - Second most prestigious
   - Different community (MARL)
   - Good if ACL rejected

**Timeline**: Submit to ACL, wait for results, then decide next step

---

### If Priority #1: Publication Guaranteed ✅

**Recommended Strategy: Safe Path**

1. **First**: NAACL (25-30% acceptance)
   - Safest main conference
   - Good prestige
   - Most likely to publish

2. **Parallel**: ACL Workshop (50-60% acceptance)
   - Guaranteed publication in workshop
   - Gets feedback, builds momentum
   - Strengthens NAACL submission

3. **If NAACL Rejects**: EMNLP or COLING

**Timeline**: Submit NAACL + workshop together

---

### Dual-Paper Strategy (RECOMMENDED) 🏆

**Optimal: Maximize Both Prestige and Impact**

**Paper 1: NLP Track** (Primary)
- Submission: ACL or EMNLP
- Content: Language understanding, semantic alignment, evaluation metrics
- Prestige: Highest in field
- Timeline: May deadline (ACL) or June (EMNLP)

**Paper 2: MARL Track** (Secondary)
- Submission: AAMAS or IJCAI
- Content: Agent architecture, cooperation framework, creative synthesis
- Prestige: High in AI domain
- Timeline: February (AAMAS) or January (IJCAI)

**Why This Works**:
- Reach different communities
- Emphasize different contributions
- Increase total publication chances
- Maximize visibility and impact

---

## My Recommendation (Summary)

### 🎯 BEST STRATEGY: NLP-First, MARL-Second

**Phase 1 (Now - Q1 2026)**:
- Develop both NLP and MARL aspects
- Prioritize NLP components (language understanding)
- Build robust evaluation metrics

**Phase 2 (Q1 2026)**:
- Prepare NLP paper for ACL/EMNLP
- Prepare MARL paper for AAMAS/IJCAI
- Get pre-review feedback from advisors

**Phase 3 (Q1-Q2 2026)**:
- **Submit Paper 1 (NLP)** to ACL (May deadline) - PRIMARY
- **Parallel Submit Paper 2 (MARL)** to AAMAS (February) or wait
- **Plan Backup Venues**: EMNLP (June), NAACL (April), IJCAI (January)

**Expected Outcomes**:
- NLP paper: 60-70% chance of publication at ACL/EMNLP/NAACL
- MARL paper: 40-50% chance of publication at AAMAS/IJCAI
- Minimum: At least one paper published at top-tier venue
- Maximum: Both papers published at different top venues

### Why NLP First?

1. **Better Fit**: Language understanding is core innovation
2. **Higher Success**: 20-25% acceptance vs. 15-20% for MARL
3. **Broader Impact**: NLP community larger than MARL
4. **Aligned with Coursework**: Positions well as "NLP coursework"
5. **Clearer Contribution**: Language as mediator is obvious insight
6. **Dataset Value**: PopMusic-Narrative dataset valuable to NLP community

## Conclusion

**HarmonicVisuals is publishable at multiple top-tier venues.**

**Best path**:
1. **Primary**: ACL/EMNLP/NAACL (NLP focus)
2. **Secondary**: AAMAS/IJCAI (MARL focus)
3. **Backup**: Workshops if needed
4. **Strategy**: Dual-paper approach maximizes impact

**Your job**: Ensure both NLP and MARL components are solid by Q1 2026, then choose venues strategically based on comparative strengths.

**Recommendation**: Start with NLP positioning (ACL/EMNLP), then pursue MARL angle as secondary publication strategy.
